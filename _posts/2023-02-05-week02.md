## Reflection on Code of Conduct

### Part 1
The code of conduct is a necessary document for an open-source project. It could define the proper behaviors in such communities so that every contributor could be respected and embraced. It also lists the scope for the instructions for users to follow and thus protecting the users under different circumstances. It also define the project maintainers' responsibility and provide conflict resolutions to users so that the users can feel safe and welcomed to participate in contributions. Other projects can benefit from such documents by adding instructions for their projects to promote a good community.

One difference between the code of conduct for [Go Project](https://go.dev/conduct) and the code of conduct for [the Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/) lies in the scope. Go project's scope applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community, while Contributor Covenant's scope within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Basically, Contributor Covenant's scope is larger than the one for Go Project as it considers more circumstances. In addition, Contributor Covenant will investigate and respond to each complaint while Go project will investigate them but not respond to each complaint.
