title: Week 7 Group Open Source Project - P5.js
---

This week, we formed a group for the next half class open source project --- p5.js. Basically, it is a `p5.js` is a JavaScript library for creative coding involving drawing, video, webcam, and sound. I think our team is formed based on our common interest in javascript. I have much experience in web developing using javascript. Amber has raised this idea for p5.js, and Jack has experience in javascript and this package as well. Therefore, it is suitable for us to make a contribution to this open source project. Furthermore, we researched the contribution section on its official website and found it is friendly and welcoming for new cnontributors. <!--more-->
We decided the schedule for contributing: firstly, we each git clone the origin repository and get familiar with its structure and code. Secondly, we can run the tests by ourselves to check current status of its code repository to see if there is new bug there. Thirdly, we get familiar with its actual application and try to create our own version of drawing with p5.js. Lastly, we look through the issues in the p5.js repository and research the current open beginner issues. So far, I have completed the first three tasks and am looking forward to our first group meeting next friday :)
