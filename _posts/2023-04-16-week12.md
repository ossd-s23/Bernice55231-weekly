### Tidepool
This week, we have the amazing guest speaker Christopher Snider for our lecture, who manages and facilitates all Clinic and Health System inquiries, demos, trainings, and approvals of the Tidepool Data Platform. Tidepool is an open-source, not-for-profit organization that aims to free diabetes data from devices, support researchers, and provide free software to the diabetes community. The important thing that applies in health-related open source project is information security, as the developers and maintainers must ensure the privacy of each patient. The second impressive topic is about the radical transparency in this project, as the developer team would make their designs, logics, and features all public to users directly so that they can get the real and useful feedbacks. In addition, it can help users to understand the functions on this platform and better help themselves for managing their health. Transparency also matters in open source project, as the contributors can access to the source code and engage in discussions freely to work together in improving the project. <!--more-->
