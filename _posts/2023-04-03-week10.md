### Group work: 
This week, we had an in-person meeting about updating the contribution. Specifically, we decided one issue that we can contribute to last week, and we worked through the week and came to review the codes together during the meeting. So we decided to use Jack's version since he has passed all the tests. Therefore, we made a pull request and now we are waiting for the response. <!--more-->During this contribution, I have discussed with the maintainers about the confusions in the source code, this helps us figure out what is the bug here in this issue and what we can contribute in the source code. Furthermore, we also contacted the one of the main maintainers via email, Qianqian Zhao, who is now in New York for a conference. She also posted on her instagram about a virtual event for all the contributors, we decided to attend that as long as we could manage our time. Last, we make a plan for the next week that we would attend the workshop of p5 so that we can learn about about the functions.
