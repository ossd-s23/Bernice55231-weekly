# Discussion with Mek
This week we have a guest speaker from Open Library, who runs this Internet Archive's largest open source, non-profit, community-powered digital library. He also leads other software engineer companies, researching in areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence. I enjoyed a lot from his presenting, especially about the inspiration of such digital library part. I felt a lot with those elders since I also would like to have more accessibility to some book resources. I used to be shocked with the high price of books in the United States, so I think the digital library can help me read more books while saving money. Also, he provided opportunities for our students to learn / participate in such open-source project. He also mentioned that they are collabrating with universities. So I think we, the cs students, can benefit a lot from his experience and his project.

# My contributions
I have contributed to the OpenStreet Map once. And since there are some bugs in our browser extension project, I also created issue for pointing out and welcome other expertises for helping us to fix it. I am now researching on some open-source projects to see which one I am really interested in and willing to make a contribution.
